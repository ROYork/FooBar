# fb_core Examples

The examples in this directory illustrate practical usage patterns for the
`fb_core` utilities. Each subdirectory builds as part of the CMake project when
`FB_CORE_BUILD_EXAMPLES` is enabled.

## Available Samples

- `hello_core` – bootstraps the library and prints diagnostic information.

Add new examples by creating a subdirectory, updating `CMakeLists.txt`, and
documenting the scenario here.
